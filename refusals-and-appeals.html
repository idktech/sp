                                                            We are Solicitors of the Supreme Court of England
                                                            and Wales, able to handle all legal matters but have
                                                            carefully decided to specialize in immigration law,
                                                            in particular, visa refusals and appeals, including
                                                            all steps through to the High Court, Court of Appeal
                                                            and the House of Lords. Visa refusal includes Entry
                                                            Clearance visa and refusals of Leave to Remain in
                                                            the UK. As you may be aware, UK immigration law changes
                                                            with time and with different government in power.
                                                            With the ever changing rules, it is necessary to
                                                            be on top of things at all times, otherwise, it will
                                                            not be possible to do everything and do them right.
                                                            As such, we have dedicated a strong team with vast
                                                            knowledge of the immigration rules and law to deal
                                                            with all types of immigration refusals and appeals.
                                                            The success of your case starts from which lawyer
                                                            you instruct to represent you.</p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            <strong>WHAT WE DO</strong>
                                                            <br> When an application for entry clearance to enter
                                                            the UK is refused, or when an application for leave
                                                            to remain in the UK is refused, a right of appeal
                                                            may be applicable and in some cases, there is no
                                                            right of appeal. Whether or not there is a right
                                                            of appeal, you can consider written representation
                                                            to the authority who refused the application. In
                                                            some cases, a right of appeal would have to be claimed,
                                                            and where this is not the best option, perhaps an
                                                            application for leave to move for judicial review.
                                                            In summary, we are able to make written representation
                                                            for you, and we are able to trigger a right of appeal
                                                            when you do not have one. We are also able to represent
                                                            you in court, as well being able to apply for judicial
                                                            review if and when advisable.

                                                            cases. Sometimes you may have a bad case but a good
                                                            lawyer and win the case, while sometimes you have
                                                            a good case but a bad lawyer and you lose the case.
                                                            You therefore must choose your lawyer with care.

                                                            <strong> WHEN YOU HAVE A RIGHT OF APPEAL</strong>
                                                            <br> Whether or not you have a right of appeal, the refusing
                                                            officer will inform you of your right, and if you
                                                            have a right of appeal, some forms will come with
                                                            the refusal notice. Many applicants for entry clearance
                                                            and also for leave to remain do have right of appeal.
                                                            It is better when you have a right of appeal than
                                                            when you do not. With a right of appeal, the immigration
                                                            judge or court serves as a reviewing body. The Court
                                                            is independent of the immigration authorities and
                                                            youcan be rest assured that you will get justice
                                                            if you deserve one. Meanwhile, good advice, good
                                                            preparation of your case, and good representation
                                                            in court wins the case. This is why you need to chose
                                                            your legal representative with care, bearing in mind
                                                            that not all bad cases you lose and not all good
                                                            cases you win. It is also true that when you have
                                                            a right of appeal, you may discover that the refusal
                                                            is justified. Therefore, you need to decide with
                                                            your legal team as to whether or not you should appeal.
                                                            There is no need sometimes to waste good money on
                                                            bad cases. Perhaps it is more advisable to re-apply
                                                            rather than to appeal. If you have to appeal, make
                                                            sure that you comply with the time limit, as an appeal
                                                            outside the time limit may not be accepted. Some
                                                            applicants, when refused, instead of appealing or
                                                            seeking legal solution to the problem, will abandon
                                                            the case and continue to live illegally or enter
                                                            the UK illegally. Those who enter the UK illegally
                                                            are taking great chance, because when caught, they
                                                            are removed. It can also be very costly sometime.
                                                            All appeals are heard in the UK. The appeal can either
                                                            be heard on paper or orally. An appeal is heard on
                                                            paper when the appellant, his sponsor or legal representative
                                                            is not present at the appeal hearing. Oral hearing
                                                            is when you, or your sponsor and or your legal team
                                                            are present at the hearing. It is noted that a lot
                                                            of applicants refused entry clearance visas do always
                                                            prefer the appeal to be heard on paper. However,
                                                            it is noted that success rates of paper hearing is
                                                            about 5% while oral hearing is about 70%. With paper
                                                            hearing, the Judge has no opportunity to hear real
                                                            and first hand evidence. It is true that for those
                                                            in the UK they can attend the hearing, while those
                                                            outside the UK cannot but their sponsor can. You
                                                            can also be represented by a lawyer, with or without
                                                            a sponsor. It should be noted also that documents
                                                            and materials considered by the courts are as at
                                                            date of decision if it is entry clearance refusal,
                                                            and as at the date of hearing if the appeal is against
                                                            refusal of leave to remain.

                                                            <strong>NO RIGHT OF APPEAL</strong>
                                                            <br> Even though you do not have a "right of appeal",
                                                            there might still be a right of appeal. This is when
                                                            you require lawyers who know what they are doing.
                                                            As rightly pointed out before, to have a right for
                                                            an independent court to review the refusal is better
                                                            than when you do not have such right. It is for your
                                                            lawyer to find this appeal right for you under the
                                                            Human Right provisions. Most applicants think that
                                                            when there is no right of appeal, that is the end
                                                            of their case. This is not correct. For example,
                                                            you will not have a right of appeal if you are not
                                                            visiting a close family member, such as first cousin,
                                                            brother, sister, or if you did not have leave when
                                                            you apply for leave to remain in the UK. When you
                                                            have no right of appeal, efforts may be made to resolve
                                                            the refusal with the refusing authority by way of
                                                            making further representations. However, it is important
                                                            not to overlook the possibility of having an appeal
                                                            right and taking the necessary steps so as not to
                                                            lose this right. Alternative to this may be an application
                                                            for Judicial Review, which is more expensive.
