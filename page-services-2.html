                                                                will come with the refusal notice. Many applicants for entry
                                                                clearance and also for leave to remain do have right of appeal.
                                                                It is better when you have a right of appeal than when you do
                                                                not. With a right of appeal, the immigration judge or court serves
                                                                as a reviewing body. The Court is independent of the immigration

                                                                if you deserve one. Meanwhile, good advice, good preparation
                                                                of your case, and good representation in court wins the case.
                                                                This is why you need to chose your legal representative with
                                                                care, bearing in mind that not all bad cases you lose and not

                                                                Therefore, you need to decide with your legal team as to whether
                                                                or not you should appeal. There is no need sometimes to waste

                                                                rather than to appeal. If you have to appeal, make sure that
                                                                you comply with the time limit, as an appeal outside the time

                                                                of appealing or seeking legal solution to the problem, will abandon

                                                                Those who enter the UK illegally are taking great chance, because
                                                                when caught, they are removed. It can also be very costly sometime.
                                                                All appeals are heard in the UK. The appeal can either be heard

                                                                of applicants refused entry clearance visas do always prefer

                                                                70%. With paper hearing, the Judge has no opportunity to hear
                                                                real and first hand evidence. It is true that for those in the

                                                                but their sponsor can. You can also be represented by a lawyer,

                                                                if the appeal is against refusal of leave to remain.

                                                                Even though you do not have a "right of appeal", there
                                                                might still be a right of appeal. This is when you require lawyers
                                                                who know what they are doing. As rightly pointed out before,
                                                                to have a right for an independent court to review the refusal
                                                                is better than when you do not have such right. It is for your

                                                                provisions. Most applicants think that when there is no right
                                                                of appeal, that is the end of their case. This is not correct.
                                                                For example, you will not have a right of appeal if you are not
                                                                visiting a close family member, such as first cousin, brother,
                                                                sister, or if you did not have leave when you apply for leave
                                                                to remain in the UK. When you have no right of appeal, efforts
                                                                may be made to resolve the refusal with the refusing authority
                                                                by way of making further representations. However, it is important
                                                                not to overlook the possibility of having an appeal right and
                                                                taking the necessary steps so as not to lose this right. Alternative

                                                                representation is to persuade the refusing officer to reverse

                                                                make sure that you do not lose your right to appeal while waiting
                                                                for a response from the refusing officer. When you have no right

                                                                with the Home Office than with the Embassy. You can appeal, if

                                                                at the same time. This way, you will not lose your right of appeal,
                                                                which must be lodged by a certain date, as the reply to the written

                                                            application is wrong. You make this application when there is

                                                            it is relevant to you. There is paper application, which is by
                                                            submitting your documents for a Judge to decide it without you
                                                            being present. Or an Oral application, which means that your
                                                            case will be heard in an open court. If you opt for Oral from
                                                            the outset, you cannot do paper application after this, while
                                                            you can apply for paper first and if not successful, can renew
                                                            it for Oral.</p>
